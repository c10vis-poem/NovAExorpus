## How to run commands and bundle executable scripts in your skills.
Skills can instruct agents to run shell commands and bundle reusable scripts in a scripts/
directory. This guide covers one-off commands, self-contained scripts with their own
dependencies, and how to design script interfaces for agentic use.
## One-offcommands
When an existing package already does what you need, you can reference it directly in your
SKILL.md instructions without a scripts/ directory. Many ecosystems provide tools that
auto-resolve dependencies at runtime.
uvx pipx npx bunx deno run go run
uvx runs Python packages in isolated environments with aggressive caching. It ships with
uv.
uvx ruff@0.8.0 check . uvx black@24.10.0 .
Not bundled with Python — requires a separate install.
Fast. Caches aggressively so repeat runs are near-instant.
Tips for one-off commands in skills:

Pin versions (e.g., npx eslint@9.0.0 ) so the command behaves the same over time.
## AgentSkills
State prerequisites in your SKILL.md (e.g., “Requires Node.js 18+”) rather than
assuming the agentʼs environment has them. For runtime-level requirements, use the
compatibility frontmatter field.
Move complex commands into scripts. A one-off command works well when youʼre
invoking a tool with a few flags. When a command grows complex enough that itʼs hard
to get right on the first try, a tested script in scripts/ is more reliable.
## Referencingscriptsfrom SKILL.md
Use relative paths from the skill directory root to reference bundled files. The agent
resolves these paths automatically — no absolute paths needed.
List available scripts in your SKILL.md so the agent knows they exist:
SKILL.md
## Available scripts
- **`scripts/validate.sh`** — Validates configuration files - **`scripts/process.py`** — Processes input data
Then instruct the agent to run them:

### AgentSkills
## Workflow
1. Run the validation script:
```bash
bash scripts/validate.sh "$INPUT_FILE"
```
2. Process the results:
```bash
python3 scripts/process.py --input results.json
```
The same relative-path convention works in support files like references/*.md — script execution paths (in code blocks) are relative to the skill directory root, because the agent runs commands from there.
### Self-containedscripts
When you need reusable logic, bundle a script in scripts/ that declares its own
dependencies inline. The agent can run the script with a single command — no separate
manifest file or install step required.
Several languages support inline dependency declarations:
Python Deno Bun Ruby
PEP 723 defines a standard format for inline script metadata. Declare dependencies in a
TOML block inside # /// markers:

---

## Page 4

scripts/extract.py
## AgentSkills
# /// script # dependencies = [ # "beautifulsoup4", # ] # ///
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
html = '<html><body><h1>Welcome</h1><p class="info">This is a test.</p></body></ print(BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser").select_one("p.info").get_text())
Run with uv (recommended):
uv run scripts/extract.py
uv run creates an isolated environment, installs the declared dependencies, and runs the
script. pipx ( pipx run scripts/extract.py ) also supports PEP 723.
Pin versions with PEP 508 specifiers: "beautifulsoup4>=4.12,<5" .
Use requires-python to constrain the Python version.
Use uv lock --script to create a lockfile for full reproducibility.
## Designingscriptsforagenticuse
When an agent runs your script, it reads stdout and stderr to decide what to do next. A few
design choices make scripts dramatically easier for agents to use.
## Avoidinteractiveprompts
This is a hard requirement of the agent execution environment. Agents operate in non-
interactive shells — they cannot respond to TTY prompts, password dialogs, or confirmation
menus. A script that blocks on interactive input will hang indefinitely.

### Accept all input via command-line flags, environment variables, or stdin:
## AgentSkills
# Bad: hangs waiting for input
$ python scripts/deploy.py
Target environment: _
# Good: clear error with guidance
$ python scripts/deploy.py
Error: --env is required. Options: development, staging, production.
Usage: python scripts/deploy.py --env staging --tag v1.2.3
## Documentusagewith --help
--help output is the primary way an agent learns your scriptʼs interface. Include a brief
### description, available flags, and usage examples:
Usage: scripts/process.py [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE
Process input data and produce a summary report.
Options:
| -- format FORMAT | Output format : json , csv , table ( default : json ) |
|---|---|
| -- output FILE | Write output to FILE instead of stdout |
| -- verbose | Print progress to stderr |
Examples:
scripts/process.py data.csv
scripts/process.py --format csv --output report.csv data.csv

## Writehelpfulerrormessages
### When an agent gets an error, the message directly shapes its next attempt. An opaque
### “Error: invalid input” wastes a turn. Instead, say what went wrong, what was expected, and

what to try:
### AgentSkills
Error: --format must be one of: json, csv, table. Received: "xml"
### Usestructuredoutput
Prefer structured formats — JSON, CSV, TSV — over free-form text. Structured formats can
be consumed by both the agent and standard tools ( jq , cut , awk ), making your script
composable in pipelines.
# Whitespace-aligned — hard to parse programmatically NAME STATUS CREATED my-service running 2025-01-15
# Delimited — unambiguous field boundaries {"name": "my-service", "status": "running", "created": "2025-01-15"}
Separate data from diagnostics: send structured data to stdout and progress messages,
warnings, and other diagnostics to stderr. This lets the agent capture clean, parseable
output while still having access to diagnostic information when needed.
### Furtherconsiderations
Idempotency. Agents may retry commands. “Create if not exists” is safer than “create
and fail on duplicate.”
Input constraints. Reject ambiguous input with a clear error rather than guessing. Use
enums and closed sets where possible.
Dry-run support. For destructive or stateful operations, a --dry-run flag lets the agent
preview what will happen.
Meaningful exit codes. Use distinct exit codes for different failure types (not found,
invalid arguments, auth failure) and document them in your --help output so the agent
knows what each code means.

Safe defaults. Consider whether destructive operations should require explicit
## AgentconfirmationSkillsflags ( --confirm , --force ) or other safeguards appropriate to the risk
level.
Predictable output size. Many agent harnesses automatically truncate tool output
beyond a threshold (e.g., 10-30K characters), potentially losing critical information. If
your script might produce large output, default to a summary or a reasonable limit, and
support flags like --offset so the agent can request more information when needed.
Alternatively, if output is large and not amenable to pagination, require agents to pass an
--output flag that specifies either an output file or - to explicitly opt in to stdout.
