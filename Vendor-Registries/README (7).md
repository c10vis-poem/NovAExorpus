# [Intern3.5-VL-4B: Multimodal 4B vision-language model for text and image understanding](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/intern3_5_vl_4b)

InternVL3.5 is a vision-language model from OpenGVLab capable of understanding both text and images for multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering and image captioning.

This is based on the implementation of Intern3.5-VL-4B found [here](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL3_5-4B).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/intern3_5_vl_4b).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Quick Start

Use our lightweight command-line interface to inspect and download Intern3.5-VL-4B:

```bash
pip install qai_hub_models_cli # (the CLI is also available with the qai-hub-models package)

# Inspect the model and list the available download options
qai-hub-models info Intern3.5-VL-4B

# Print performance and accuracy metrics
qai-hub-models perf Intern3.5-VL-4B
qai-hub-models numerics Intern3.5-VL-4B

# Download a ready-to-deploy asset
qai-hub-models fetch Intern3.5-VL-4B --runtime geniex_qairt --precision w4a16
```
See the [CLI README](../../../../cli/README.md)
for the full list of commands and filters.

## Deploying Intern3.5-VL-4B on-device

Follow the [GenieX quickstart](https://geniex.aihub.qualcomm.com/en/get-started/quickstart) to install GenieX and deploy the model on a target device.

See the [LLM-on-Genie](https://github.com/qualcomm/ai-hub-apps/tree/main/tutorials/llm_on_genie) tutorial to run with the Genie runtime. Note: Genie support will be deprecated soon.


## Setup
### 1. Install the package
Install the base package, then use the `qai-hub-models` CLI to install this
recipe's dependencies:
```bash
# NOTE: 3.10 <= PYTHON_VERSION < 3.14 is supported.
pip install qai-hub-models
qai-hub-models install intern3_5_vl_4b
```
For intern3_5_vl_4b, some additional functionality can be faster or is available
only with a GPU on the host machine.

- 🟢 Exporting the model for on-device deployment (GPU not required)
- 🟡 Running the demo (GPU recommended for speed, but not required)
- 🟡 Running evaluation (GPU recommended for speed, but not required)
- 🔴 Quantizing the model (GPU required)

If you are quantizing your own variant of intern3_5_vl_4b, a dedicated CUDA enabled
GPU (40 GB VRAM for 3B models to 80 GB VRAM for 8B models) is recommended. A GPU
can also increase the speed of evaluation and demo of your quantized model
significantly but is not strictly required. The CLI auto-detects CUDA and installs
the GPU-flavored dependencies (e.g. the AIMET ONNX wheel) when available.

### 2. Configure Qualcomm® AI Hub Workbench
Sign-in to [Qualcomm® AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/) with your
Qualcomm® ID. Once signed in navigate to `Account -> Settings -> API Token`.

With this API token, you can configure your client to run models on the cloud
hosted devices.
```bash
qai-hub configure --api_token API_TOKEN
```
Navigate to [docs](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com/docs/) for more information.

## Run CLI Demo
Run the following simple CLI demo to verify the model is working end to end:

```bash
qai-hub-models demo intern3_5_vl_4b
```
More details on the CLI tool can be found with the `--help` option. See
[demo.py](demo.py) for sample usage of the model including pre/post processing
scripts. Please refer to our [general instructions on using
models](../../../#getting-started) for more usage instructions.

## Export for on-device deployment
To run the model on Qualcomm® devices, you must export the model for use with an edge runtime such as
TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, or Qualcomm AI Engine Direct.
Export the pre-quantized model (published on AI Hub) for on-device deployment:
```bash
qai-hub-models export intern3_5_vl_4b --checkpoint DEFAULT_W4A16
```
`--checkpoint` also accepts `DEFAULT` (the model's default precision).

Optionally, quantize your own variant first and export the resulting checkpoint:
```bash
python -m qai_hub_models.models.intern3_5_vl_4b.quantize --precision w4a16 --output-dir ./quantized_checkpoint
qai-hub-models export intern3_5_vl_4b --checkpoint ./quantized_checkpoint
```
Additional options are documented with the `--help` option.
