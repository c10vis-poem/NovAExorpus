# [Qwen3.5-2B: Balanced 2B parameter model from the Qwen3.5 series for on-device inference](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen3_5_2b)

Qwen3.5 is the latest multilingual language model series from Alibaba Cloud with improved reasoning and instruction-following capabilities over Qwen3.

This is based on the implementation of Qwen3.5-2B found [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B).
This repository contains scripts for optimized on-device export suitable to run on Qualcomm® devices. More details on model performance across various devices, can be found [here](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/models/qwen3_5_2b).

Qualcomm AI Hub Models uses [Qualcomm AI Hub Workbench](https://workbench.aihub.qualcomm.com) to compile, profile, and evaluate this model. [Sign up](https://myaccount.qualcomm.com/signup) to run these models on a hosted Qualcomm® device.

## Quick Start

Use our lightweight command-line interface to inspect and download Qwen3.5-2B:

```bash
pip install qai_hub_models_cli # (the CLI is also available with the qai-hub-models package)

# Inspect the model and list the available download options
qai-hub-models info Qwen3.5-2B

# Print performance and accuracy metrics
qai-hub-models perf Qwen3.5-2B
qai-hub-models numerics Qwen3.5-2B

# Download a ready-to-deploy asset
qai-hub-models fetch Qwen3.5-2B --runtime geniex_llamacpp --precision q4_0
```
See the [CLI README](../../../../cli/README.md)
for the full list of commands and filters.

## Deploying Qwen3.5-2B on-device

Follow the [GenieX quickstart](https://geniex.aihub.qualcomm.com/en/get-started/quickstart) to install GenieX and deploy the model on a target device.
