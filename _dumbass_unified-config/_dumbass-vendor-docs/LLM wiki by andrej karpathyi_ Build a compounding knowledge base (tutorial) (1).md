Key Takeaways
An LLM wiki is a structured, AI-maintained knowledge base that grows smarter every time you add a source — unlike RAG, which rediscovers knowledge from scratch on every query.
The pattern was introduced by Andrej Karpathy in a GitHub Gist in April 2026 and went viral among developers within days.
You can build your first LLM wiki in under 30 minutes using five free research papers, a folder on your computer, and Claude Code or Claude.ai
If you have ever uploaded a PDF to ChatGPT, asked a question, and then uploaded
the same PDF again the next day to ask a follow-up.. you already understand the
problem an LLM wiki solves.
Most AI knowledge tools today are stateless. Every session starts from zero.
Nothing you learn in one conversation carries over to the next. The model retrieves,
answers, and forgets. Ask the same question tomorrow and it rebuilds the answer
from scratch.
Andrej Karpathy, co-founder of OpenAI and former Director of AI at Tesla, proposed
a different approach in April 2026. He called it an LLM wiki: a persistent, structured
knowledge base that an AI agent actively builds and maintains, so that knowledge
compounds over time instead of evaporating between sessions.
This tutorial walks you through exactly how to build one, using five foundational AI
research papers as your starting material.

## LLM Wiki By Andrej Karpathy
## What Is an LLM Wiki and Why Does It Matter?
An LLM wiki is a folder of plain markdown files that an AI agent reads, writes, and
maintains on your behalf. Each file is an entity page: a structured, Wikipedia-style
entry for one concept, linked to related concepts using [[wiki-links]].
The key difference from every other knowledge tool is what happens when you add a
new source.
In a standard RAG system (NotebookLM, ChatGPT file uploads, most enterprise
tools), adding a new document means it gets indexed and sits alongside your other
documents. When you ask a question, the system retrieves relevant chunks and
generates an answer. The documents themselves never change. Nothing is
synthesized. Nothing is connected.
In an LLM wiki, adding a new document triggers a compilation step. The agent reads
the new source and the existing wiki, then:
Updates existing pages with new information

Creates new entity pages for concepts that appear for the first time
Adds [[wiki-links]] connecting the new concept to related ones already in the wiki
Flags contradictions between the new source and what was previously written
Over time, the wiki becomes a connected knowledge graph, not just a pile of
documents. At 10 pages it answers basic questions. At 50 pages it starts
synthesizing across ideas you never explicitly connected. At 100+ pages, it can
answer questions where the answer doesn't exist in any single source, because the
answer lives in the relationships between pages.

### LLM Wiki vs RAG: What's the Real Difference?
RAG LLM WIKI
Knowledge persistence None — stateless Full — builds over time
Multi-document synthesis Per query, from scratch Pre-compiled into pages
Contradiction detection No Yes — flagged during compilation
Source traceability High Moderate (page-level)
Setup complexity Low Low–Medium
Best for Quick Q&A on documents Deep, growing research topics
The tradeoff worth knowing: RAG is better when your data changes daily or when
exact source traceability matters for every claim. LLM wiki is better when you are

across your knowledge base rather than just retrieve from it.

After this step you should have: Five PDF files saved to your computer.
## Step 2: Create Your Folder Structure
Create a new folder anywhere on your computer — your Desktop, Documents,
wherever makes sense. Name it my-wiki.
Inside it, create two folders:
my-wiki/ ├── raw/ └── wiki/
raw/ is where you drop all your source files — PDFs, articles, notes. You never edit
anything in here manually.
wiki/ is where the compiled entity pages live. The LLM writes here.
Now move your five downloaded PDFs into the raw/ folder.
### LLM wiki folder structure with raw and wiki directories
After this step you should have: A folder structure with five PDFs sitting inside raw/.
## Step 3: Run the Compilation Prompt
This is the core step, where the LLM wiki pattern actually kicks in.
### Option A: Using Claude.ai (no terminal needed)

---

## Page 8

Open Claude.ai and upload all five PDFs at once using the attachment button. Then
send this prompt:
Read these papers and create entity pages in wiki/. For each key concept create a markdown file with a summary, explanation, related links using [[brackets]], and note any contradictions between papers.
That is genuinely all you need. Claude will generate one markdown entity page per
key concept — each with a summary, an explanation, wiki-links to related concepts,
and any contradictions it finds between the papers.
Copy each page into a .md file in your wiki/ folder.
Additionally: If you want more structure as your wiki grows, you can extend the
prompt to also ask Claude to create an index.md listing every entity page with a one-
line description, and a log.md tracking what was compiled and when. These become
useful navigational tools once you have 30+ pages, but they are not needed to get
started.
### Option B: Using Claude Code (terminal)
If you have Claude Code installed, open a terminal, navigate to your wiki folder, and
launch it:

---

## Page 9

cd ~/my-wiki claude
Then paste the same prompt above. Claude Code will read the files directly and
write the pages into wiki/ for you — no copy-pasting needed.
# Claude Code prompt for creating LLM wiki
# Entity pages created for LLM Wiki by Claude Code

After this step you should have: 10–20 markdown entity pages in your wiki/
folder.
## Step 4: Open Your Wiki in Obsidian
Install Obsidian (free, no account needed). When it launches, click Open folder as
vault and select your wiki/ folder.
### Using Obsidian to create graphs for LLM Wiki

---

## Page 11

Two things to look at immediately:
Graph View — press Ctrl+G (or Cmd+G on Mac). You will see your entity pages as
nodes, with [[wiki-links]] rendered as edges connecting them. After just five papers,
you should see a small but meaningful graph — transformer architecture linking to
attention mechanism, BERT linking to fine-tuning, RLHF linking to alignment and
GPT.
### Obsidian graph view of an LLM wiki showing linked entity pages on
### transformer concepts
After this step you should have: A visual, navigable knowledge graph in Obsidian.
## Step 5: Add More Sources and Watch It Compound

---

## Page 12

# Drop a new paper into raw/, any paper related to transformers, language models, or
# AI alignment works well. Then run the compilation prompt again, this time with a
# small addition:
A new source has been added. Read it alongside the existing wiki pages. Update any existing entity pages affected by this new source. Create new entity pages for any new concepts introduced. Flag any contradictions with previously compiled knowledge.
# This is where the compound effect becomes visible. The new paper does not just
# create new pages, it enriches the pages already there. A page on “attention
# mechanism” that had two outgoing links might now have five. A claim that went
# unchallenged might now have a contradiction flagged.

# Step 6: Run a Linting Pass
# Every time your wiki reaches roughly 20 new pages, run this maintenance prompt:
Audit the entire wiki/ folder. Identify: 1. Orphan pages — pages that no other page links to 2. Missing pages — concepts referenced with [[brackets]] that dont have their own page yet 3. Contradictions — claims that conflict across pages 4. Stale claims — things that may have been superseded by a more recent source in raw/ Suggest fixes and, where

This is the self-healing step. It is what keeps the wiki accurate as it grows, rather
than slowly drifting into quiet inconsistency.
Tip: "Run linting after every 20 new pages, or any time you add a source that significantly updates a topic already in the wiki."
After this step you should have: A clean, internally consistent wiki with no orphan
pages and all flagged contradictions resolved or noted.
### Common Mistakes to Avoid
Putting too much in one page. Each entity page should cover exactly one concept. If
a page starts covering two ideas, split it. Dense single-concept pages create better
links and better answers.
Never running linting. Small errors propagate fast in a wiki. A wrong claim on one
page gets linked to by three others, and now you have organized misinformation.
Run the audit pass regularly.
Adding too many unrelated topics at once. The wiki compounds best when sources
are topically related. Starting with five papers on the same subject produces a richer
graph than five papers on five different subjects.
### Frequently Asked Questions
What is an LLM wiki? An LLM wiki is a personal knowledge base made of plain
markdown files that an AI agent actively builds and maintains. Unlike RAG systems
that search raw documents on every query, an LLM wiki pre-compiles knowledge
into structured, interlinked entity pages — so answers compound over time instead
of being rediscovered from scratch.

Who created the LLM wiki concept? Andrej Karpathy, co-founder of OpenAI and
former Director of AI at Tesla, described the concept in a GitHub Gist published in
April 2026. The post went viral in the developer community within days of
publication.
Do I need to know how to code to build an LLM wiki? No. The Claude.ai version of
this tutorial requires no coding — just uploading PDFs and pasting prompts. Claude
Code makes the workflow faster and more automated, but it is not required to get
started.
How is an LLM wiki different from Notion or Obsidian alone? Notion and Obsidian
are tools for human-written notes — you organize and write everything yourself. An
LLM wiki uses those same tools as the viewing interface, but the actual compilation,
linking, and maintenance is done by the AI agent. You supply raw sources; the agent
builds the structure.
How big can an LLM wiki get? Karpathy’s own wiki reached approximately 100
articles and 400,000 words before he noted that the LLM could still navigate it
efficiently using the index and summaries. At that scale, the system was still faster
and more accurate than a RAG pipeline for his research use case.
What file types work in the raw/ folder? PDFs work best for research papers.
Markdown files work well for articles clipped from the web (the Obsidian Web
Clipper browser extension converts any webpage to markdown automatically). Plain
text, exported chat conversations, and .md notes all work. The LLM reads whatever
you drop in.
### What to Build Next
Once your first wiki is running, a few natural next steps:
Add the Obsidian Web Clipper browser extension. It converts any webpage to
markdown and saves it directly to your raw/ folder. This makes ingesting articles
as fast as bookmarking them.

Try topic-specific wikis. One wiki per research area tends to produce cleaner
graphs than one giant wiki. Start a separate one for a new topic rather than mixing
everything together.
Fine-tune on your wiki. At 100+ well-maintained pages, the wiki becomes a high-
quality training set. You can eventually fine-tune a smaller model on it — turning
your personal research into a custom private intelligence.
