name strategic-compact
Suggests manual context compaction at logical intervals to preserve context through task phases rather than arbitrary auto-compaction. Use description when a session is approaching a context limit and a task phase is a natural place to compact.
origin metadata ECC
### Strategic Compact Skill
Suggests manual /compact at strategic points in your workflow rather than relying on arbitrary
auto-compaction.
### When to Activate
Running long sessions that approach context limits (200K+ tokens)
Working on multi-phase tasks (research → plan → implement → test)
Switching between unrelated tasks within the same session

After completing a major milestone and starting new work
When responses slow down or become less coherent (context pressure)
### Why Strategic Compaction?
Auto-compaction triggers at arbitrary points:
Often mid-task, losing important context
No awareness of logical task boundaries
Can interrupt complex multi-step operations
Strategic compaction at logical boundaries:
After exploration, before execution — Compact research context, keep implementation plan
After completing a milestone — Fresh start for next phase
Before major context shifts — Clear exploration context before different task
### How It Works
The suggest-compact.js script runs on PreToolUse (Edit/Write) and combines two signals:
1. Context size (primary) — Reads the latest usage record from the session transcript ( transcript_path in the hook payload) and sums input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens (the true context size of the turn). Suggests /compact at a window-scaled threshold — 160k tokens on a 200k window, 250k on a 1M window (detected from a [1m] model marker, or inferred when observed tokens already exceed 200k) — and re-reminds after every additional 60k tokens of context growth
2. Tool-call count (secondary) — Counts tool invocations in session; suggests at a configurable threshold (default: 50 calls), then every 25 calls after
Tool count alone is a weak proxy for window pressure: a few large file reads or MCP responses can fill the window in very few calls, while many tiny calls can cross 50 with a near-empty window. The context-size signal fires when it actually matters.

### Hook Setup
Installed as a plugin? No setup is needed. The plugin's hooks/hooks.json already registers
suggest-compact.js pre:edit-write:suggest-compact (hook id , active in the standard
strict and hook profiles). Do not copy the block below into ~/.claude/settings.json —
~/.claude/scripts/ does not exist on plugin installs, and duplicating a plugin hook causes
double execution.
./install.sh If installed manually ( ), add to your ~/.claude/settings.json :
{
"hooks": { "PreToolUse": [ { "matcher": "Edit", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/.claude/scripts/ho }, { "matcher": "Write", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/.claude/scripts/ho } ] }
}
### Configuration
Environment variables:
COMPACT_THRESHOLD — Tool calls before first suggestion (default: 50)
COMPACT_CONTEXT_THRESHOLD — Context tokens before the context-size suggestion
(default: 160000 on a 200k window, 250000 on a 1M window; 0 disables the context
signal)
COMPACT_CONTEXT_INTERVAL — Additional context tokens before the suggestion repeats
(default: 60000)
COMPACT_STATE_TTL_DAYS — Days before stale per-session state files in the temp dir are
swept (default: 14)
ECC_CONTEXT_WINDOW_TOKENS — Explicit context-window size, in tokens, overriding auto-
detection. Set this for large-window models whose reported id lacks a [1m] marker (e.g.
400k Opus 4.x, or a new 1M-window model family) so the threshold scales to the real
window instead of defaulting to 200k and overstating context usage.

CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW — Claude Code's native window-size override, in tokens; honored as a fallback when ECC_CONTEXT_WINDOW_TOKENS is unset.
The context window is otherwise auto-detected from a [1m] model marker or inferred
signal, set one of the overrides above so the /compact suggestion fires at the right point.
### Compaction Decision Guide
Use this table to decide when to compact:
Phase Transition Compact? Why
Research context is bulky; plan is the distilled Research → Planning Yes output
Planning → Plan is written down (a file, or the task list if you Yes Implementation have one); free up context for code
Implementation → Keep if tests reference recent code; compact if Maybe Testing switching focus
Debugging → Next Yes Debug traces pollute context for unrelated work feature
Losing variable names, file paths, and partial state Mid-implementation No is costly
After a failed Clear the dead-end reasoning before trying a new Yes approach approach
### What Survives Compaction
Understanding what persists helps you compact with confidence:
Persists Lost
CLAUDE.md instructions Intermediate reasoning and analysis
Files on disk File contents you previously read
Memory files ( ~/.claude/memory/ ) Multi-step conversation context
Git state (commits, branches) Tool call history and counts

Persists Lost
The task list — only if you have the todo tools (see Nuanced user preferences stated below) verbally
## Don't rely on the task list surviving — it may not exist
5, Mythos 5 and newer models ( TodoWrite , TaskCreate/Get/Update/List ). CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1 brings them back, but that is a per-machine
environment setting — it does not travel with this skill, so you cannot assume the reader has it.
This matters because "my todo list survives compaction" is a reason people compact instead of writing state down. If the tools are absent there is no list to survive, and the plan is simply gone. Write the plan to a file before compacting — a file persists on every version and every model. Treat the task list as a convenience that may be missing, never as your durable record.
## Best Practices
1. Compact after planning — Once the plan is finalized and written to a file, compact to start fresh
2. Compact after debugging — Clear error-resolution context before continuing
3. Don't compact mid-implementation — Preserve context for related changes
4. Read the suggestion — The hook tells you when, you decide if
5. Write before compacting — Save important context to files or memory before compacting
/compact 6. Use with a summary — Add a custom message: /compact Focus on implementing auth middleware next
## Token Optimization Patterns
## Trigger-Table Lazy Loading
Instead of loading full skill content at session start, use a trigger table that maps keywords to skill paths. Skills load only when triggered, reducing baseline context by 50%+:
Trigger Skill Load When
"test", "tdd", "coverage" tdd-workflow User mentions testing

---

## Page 6

Trigger Skill Load When
"security", "auth", "xss" security-review Security-related work
"deploy", "ci/cd" deployment-patterns Deployment context
## Context Composition Awareness
Monitor what's consuming your context window:
CLAUDE.md files — Always loaded, keep lean
Loaded skills — Each skill adds 1-5K tokens
Conversation history — Grows with each exchange
Tool results — File reads, search results add bulk
## Duplicate Instruction Detection
Common sources of duplicate context:
~/.claude/rules/
Same rules in both and project .claude/rules/
Skills that repeat CLAUDE.md instructions
Multiple skills covering overlapping domains
